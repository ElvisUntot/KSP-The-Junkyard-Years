rename your "GameDate" folder in something else

create a new "GameData" folder

create a "Squad" folder there

copy everything from your old "Squad" folder into the new one, everything but "Parts" and  "SPP"

create a "Parts" folder in your "Squad" folder

copy "externalCommandSeat", "mk1LanderCan", "probeCoreCube" from the "Command" folder

copy "liquidEngine24-77", "liquidEngineLV-1", "solidBoosterSep", from the "Engine" folder

copy "fuelTankOscarB", "fuelTankToroidal" from the FuelTank folder
