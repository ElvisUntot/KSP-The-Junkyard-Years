KSP:The Junkyard Years
======================
(A Mod for KSP) 

Jebs adventures when space was a dream and his junkyard was everything he had. The time when he did his first mun orbit with just a bunch of oscars, beams and some 24-77 welded to an old LanderCan. (and he still won't tell us how he did survive the landing without a parachute)

Details: in the moment, i am throwing out all parts that look too expensive and make it too easy to build a "normal" rocket. Next step, looking for new parts to include without breaking the idea of the usage of junk parts.

The mod will contain only a filelist and a installation guide at the beginning, since all the parts are stolen from somewhere and so i can not bundle them. (later there will be some batch files to automate this, since you will need a new GameData directory)
