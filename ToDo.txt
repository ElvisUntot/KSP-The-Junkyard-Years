In no order:

create a few batch files that rename the old GameData folder, create a new one and then copy all the files 

find new parts to include (do *you* have any idea, if so, tell me)

original parts (i do not think i have the time/money/knowledge to do that anytime soon) 


In the moment, i am pondering what parachute i will include, if any at all.
